# Android ConwaysGameOfLife
A mobile version of the classic cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life. Users can tap squares on a grid to activate and deactivate cells, then press play to watch how the configuration evolves over time. There is a slider that controls how fast the board evolves, and a fast forward button that steps one generation at a time. 
Users can also save configurations and then access them later. Each configuration is saved as a JSON file.

I wrote this in Java as the final project for an 8 week Android development class.
